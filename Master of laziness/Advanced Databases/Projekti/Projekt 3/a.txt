review/summary: Requires too much coordination
review/text: I bought this software for my 5 year old. He has a couple of the other RH software games and he likes them a lot. This game, however, was too challenging for him. The biggest problem I see is that the game requires the child to be able to maneuver the vehicle using all 4 scroll keys on the keyboard. During one exercise, which by the way you can't get to the next level until you complete this exercise, the game requires that you use the keys to move while watching out for falling lava rocks and clouds, monitor a fuel gauge, watch arrow indicators that help you determine where objects are in the arena below, and watch a scope that shows animals when you're hovering over the top of them.I tried to perform this exercise myself and got frustrated. It's just too hard to expect even a 7 year old to complete this exercise let alone a 5 year old.There are some exercises he can complete himself but they mostly require using the left, right keys.I don't know who this game would be good for. Parts of it would be too easy for someone 7 or older. Yet some parts are too difficult for those younger than that.

review/summary: You can't pick which parts you want to play!
review/text: I got this for my 4 year old son because he really likes Rescue Heroes and it sounded like it would have some adventures for him.What the description doesn't tell you is that you can't pick which activities you want to play. You have to complete one part before you can go to the next which just doesn't make sense for this age group. There are certain parts he has no interest in or are too challenging so he gets frustrated and can't get to play the parts he does enjoy. The graphics for the different rescues are very basic and each time you go through the sequence it's exactly the same stuff, so even if he could do it I think it would get boring fast. The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is that my son has enjoyed watching it (while I play it). If you're looking for something your child can do easily by themselves without getting frustated - don't get it. Almost all of the play involves using the arrow keys instead of the mouse. If your child has no problem with the arrow keys, he might not have trouble.

review/summary: Very Frustrating
review/text: My three year old son was very excited to get this but after two attempts at playing it hasn't been touched since. You are not able to use the mouse through any of the games except for the "power-up segments" instead you are using the up-down arrows on the keyboard - too hard for him and not much fun. Very disapointed with this game and wish I could return it.

review/text: My almost four year old loves this game. It can be challenging but that's what makes it worth playing I guess. Worth buying if your child likes Rescue Heroes or even just likes rescue equipment.(We've never seen the show)

review/summary: Lava Landslide
review/text: I gave this game to my son as an early birthday present. He's almost four and loves the Rescue Heroes. The reviews I read were mixed so I decided to buy it anyway. I'm really glad I did. Sure it's challenging, but it's a good excuse for the parents to get involved. First I did the hard parts for him, to show him what needed to be done. Then I guided him through them and finally he ended up doing it all by himself. He was so proud when he accomplished the hard tasks that he couldn't do at first!Unlike most computer games this one requires the use of the arrow keys instead of the mouse. Well, it's always nice to learn new skills.I can't wait to give my son the two other RH games I baught for his birthday. I have no doubt he'll love them too.

review/summary: Mind numbing
review/text: This game makes you do the same things over and over, it never holds my son's attention long enough to get to the next level. There is no choice of games you have to do every thing in order. We have another Rescue Heroes game and both my boys 3 and 6 love it, but this one is a dog!

review/summary: pretty good, especially for the younger kids (2-3 years plus)
review/text: I think this one is our favourite game for my younger daughter. She could play this when she was 2.5 years and loved it. It may be a bit simple for the older kids (6+) as they will do it fairly quickly as there are not many challenges or puzzles to solve.This is more of an art game than a challenge game - lots of decorating with the 6 different paintbrushes (each creates a different scene) and there are many decorate it yourself items like making flowers for the garden, making the masks and the decorating the thrones. There is no wrong way to do them (you can't get decorating wrong like you can with the puzzles).The only negative would be the maze at the end, you have to move with the arrow keys and this I always have to help her with as it is a bit difficult. The graphics are great, sound great and my favourite is most of the game is done with the mouse so it is easy for kids (not like the Pegasus game which is terrible!). Older kids may prefer the Princess and the Pauper game if they want a game that lasts longer.

review/summary: Definitely enjoyed!
review/text: This was a gift for my 6 yr old daughter. She is a big Barbie fan as well as loves to use the computer. She is still enjoying this game. She completed it in a few hours which worried me at first, but she loves to do it over and over again. The music is enjoyable and the colors are vibrant. It seems to be very user friendly also....my daughter has not really needed my help to use it once she started it the first time.

review/text: My four year old daughter loves everything Barbie and loves the Rapunzel movie. This game is tons of fun, even for a 42 year old. We love playing it together. We love decorating all the rooms and finding the gems. What even better is, she can play it alone and I get some me time!

review/text: My four-year-old loved this CD. She played it over and over until she exhausted the CD about 10 times. She was able to play it by herself. It is cleverly designed with games that utilize a child's creativity. I highly recommend it for young girls.
