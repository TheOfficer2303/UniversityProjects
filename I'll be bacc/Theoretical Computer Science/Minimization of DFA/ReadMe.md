This program for its input takes Deterministic finite automaton and minimizes it. It transforms DFA to the equivalent DFA that has a minimum number of states.
It takes input like this:
1. row: all states
2. row: all symbols
3. row: acceptable states
4. row: initial state
5. row to end: transitions

States and alphabet are separated by comma, and transition should look like this: oldState,symbol->newState
